    From experiencing deep, restorative sleep<br>
    to feeling energized and focused the next<br>
    day, a good night’s sleep can seem pretty<br>
    miraculous. And it is. Yet many of us know<br>
    very little about how to make the most of<br>
    the sleep we can get (if any!).<br>
    In this eBook, we’ll dive into everything<br>
    you need to know about sleep—from why<br>
    we need it and common sleep issues, to<br>
    tips for your best sleep and the magic of<br>
    lucid dreams.<br>

    So why, more specifically, is sticking to your<br>
    circadian rhythm and getting enough sleep so<br>
    important? A few key reasons are (1):<br>

    Your circadian rhythm works along<br>

    our slumber needs, we all have an<br>
    Melatonin is produced and released<br>
    internal body clock that regulates our<br>
    in your body depending on the time<br>
    sleep. It’s basically our sleep/wake<br>
    of day. When it’s dark out, more<br>
    monitor that controls when we feel<br>
    melatonin is released, helping you<br>
    tired and in need of rest and when<br>
    sleep. And when it’s light, less is<br>
    we feel energized and ready to start<br>
    released, helping you feel more<br>

    Your circadian rhythm helps ensure<br>

    While we know skimping on sleep isn’t<br>
    good for us, millions of us still don’t seem<br>
    to log enough hours each night. In fact,<br>
    surveys conducted by the National Sleep<br>
    Foundation found that at least 40 million<br>
    Americans suffer from over 70 different<br>
    sleep disorders (6).<br>
    What’s more, the survey found that 60% of<br>
    adults report having sleep issues at least a<br>
    few nights a week. The result? At least a few<br>
    times every month, more than 40% of adults<br>
    experience daytime drowsiness severe<br>
    enough to disrupt their daily activities. And<br>
    it’s not just among adults. The same study<br>
    found that 69% of children experience sleep<br>
    issues at least a few nights a week (6). So<br>
    what’s going on here?<br>

    flash. This attitude can trigger anxiety<br>

    So how do we go about improving our<br>
    sleep? A basic understanding of your sleep<br>
    stages (and what’s happening in your body<br>
    in each) is a good place to start. It can help<br>
    you see where you’re missing the mark and<br>
    help you make the shifts you need to start<br>
    sleeping more soundly.<br>
    There are two types of sleep: REM and<br>
    non-REM. Within non-REM sleep, there are<br>
    three stages you pass through en route to<br>
    the fourth stage, REM. Every night we cycle<br>
    through these four stages several times<br>
    for different lengths of time. In general,<br>
    non-REM cycles are longer toward the<br>
    beginning of your sleep, while REM cycles<br>
    are longer toward the end (7).<br>
