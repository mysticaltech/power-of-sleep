    <A name=3></a>Chapter One: From experiencing deep, restorative sleep to feeling energized and focused the next day,
    a good night’s sleep can seem pretty miraculous. And it is. Yet many of us know very little about how to make the
    most of the sleep we can get (if any!). In this eBook, we’ll dive into everything you need to know about sleep—from
    why we need it and common sleep issues, to tips for your best sleep and the magic of lucid dreams. NOTE: Remember,

    So why, more specifically, is sticking to your circadian rhythm and getting enough sleep so important? A few key
    reasons are (1): • It allows your mind and body to recharge so that you feel refreshed when you wake up. • It helps

    enough hours each night. In fact, surveys conducted by the National Sleep Foundation found that at least 40 million
    Americans suffer from over 70 different sleep disorders (6). What’s more, the survey found that 60% of adults report
    having sleep issues at least a few nights a week. The result? At least a few times every month, more than 40% of
    adults experience daytime drowsiness severe enough to disrupt their daily activities. And it’s not just among
    adults. The same study found that 69% of children experience sleep issues at least a few nights a week (6). So

    (and what’s happening in your body in each) is a good place to start. It can help you see where you’re missing the
    mark and help you make the shifts you need to start sleeping more soundly. There are two types of sleep: REM and
    non-REM. Within non-REM sleep, there are three stages you pass through en route to the fourth stage, REM. Every
    night we cycle through these four stages several times for different lengths of time. In general, non-REM cycles are
    longer toward the beginning of your sleep, while REM cycles are longer toward the end (7).<br>
